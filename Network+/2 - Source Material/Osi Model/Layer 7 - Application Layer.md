# Layer 7 - Application Layer

The **Application Layer** is the top layer of the OSI model and provides **application-level services** to the user. This is where a user interacts with the network via software, although the layer itself does not represent the actual applications (e.g., web browsers or email clients), but rather the protocols and services those apps rely on.

---

### Application Services

- Unites communication between multiple network-aware applications.
    
- Ensures proper interaction between local and remote application processes.
    

---

### Service Advertisement

- Devices advertise their available services on the network so other devices can easily locate and use them.
    
- Example: A network printer constantly advertises its availability so that devices like smartphones or laptops can detect and connect to it without manual configuration.

### Layer 7 Devices & Protocols

**Email Protocols:**

- **POP3** (Post Office Protocol v3)
    
- **IMAP** (Internet Message Access Protocol)
    
- **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
    

**Web Browsing:**

- **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
    
- **HTTPS** (HTTP Secure)
    

**Domain Name System:**

- **DNS** – Resolves domain names to IP addresses
    

**File Transfer Protocols:**

- **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol)
    
- **FTPS** (FTP Secure – adds TLS/SSL)
    
- **SFTP** (SSH File Transfer Protocol – not the same as FTP)
    

**Remote Access / Management:**

- **Telnet** – Insecure remote terminal
    
- **SSH** – Secure Shell for encrypted terminal access
    
- **SNMP** – Simple Network Management Protocol, used for monitoring and managing devices
