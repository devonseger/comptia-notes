# Layer 6 - Presentation Layer

The **Presentation Layer** is responsible for **translating, formatting, and encrypting** data exchanged between applications. It ensures that the data sent by the application layer of one system is readable by the application layer of another.

---

### Data Formatting

- Ensures **compatibility** between systems by converting data into a standardized format.
    
- Common formats:
    
    - **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**  
        A universal text format that ensures data is readable and structured for transfer to the [[Layer 7 - Application Layer]].
        
    - **Image Formats**: GIF, JPG, PNG
        
    - **Video Formats**: MP4, MOV
        
    - **Text Encoding**: Unicode, etc.

### Encryption

- Protects data during transmission by **scrambling** it so unauthorized parties cannot read it.
    
- Common protocols:
    
    - **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**  
        Provides secure communication by creating an encrypted tunnel.
        
    - **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** _(older standard)_

### Layer 6 Devices & Protocols

- **Scripting and Markup Languages**: HTML, JavaScript, CSS
    
- **Standard Text Formats**: ASCII, Unicode
    
- **Image Formats**: JPG, PNG, GIF
    
- **Video Formats**: MOV, MP4
    
- **Encryption Protocols**: TLS, SSL
