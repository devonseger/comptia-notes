# Wireless Antennas

Antennas are devices designed to **transmit and receive radio frequency (RF) signals**, enabling wireless communication between access points, clients, and other network devices.

---

## Omnidirectional Antennas

- Radiate signal **equally in all directions** (360° horizontal coverage)
- Used for **broad area coverage**
- Common in:
  - **Wireless access points (WAPs)**
  - Home routers
- Best suited for:
  - Small or open areas
  - Centralized placement

---

## Unidirectional Antennas

- Focus signal in **one direction**
- Provides:
  - **Stronger signal strength**
  - **Longer range** in the targeted area
- Ideal for:
  - **Point-to-point** links
  - Long, narrow spaces (e.g., hallways, outdoor corridors)

---

## Yagi Antennas

- A **specific type** of unidirectional antenna
- Known for:
  - **High gain** and **narrow beamwidth**
- Commonly used for:
  - Long-distance outdoor connections
  - **Fixed-location** setups (e.g., building-to-building wireless bridges)

---

## Parabolic Antennas

- Use a **dish-shaped reflector** to focus RF signals into a **very narrow beam**
- Capable of **extremely high gain** and **long-range** transmission
- Often used in:
  - **Satellite communications**
  - **Microwave links**
  - **Long-range point-to-point** wireless networks
- Directionality makes them ideal for:
  - Focused, high-efficiency connections over miles
  - Environments with minimal interference or line-of-sight obstacles

## Summary Table

| Antenna Type     | Directionality | Use Case                          | Notes                                 |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Omnidirectional  | 360°           | APs in open indoor areas          | Default for many WAPs                 |
| Unidirectional   | Narrow beam    | Long hallways, directional links  | Stronger signal, narrow focus         |
| Yagi             | Very narrow    | Long-range, outdoor fixed links   | High gain, line-of-sight required     |
| Parabolic        | Ultra-narrow   | Satellite/microwave, P2P over miles | Extremely high gain, long distance  |
