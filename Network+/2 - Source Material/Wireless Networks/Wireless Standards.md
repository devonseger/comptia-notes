# Wireless Standards

The **IEEE 802.11 family** defines wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) standards. Each version introduced improvements in speed, frequency usage, range, and efficiency.

---

## 802.11a (Wi-Fi 1)

- Operates in the **5 GHz** band
- Speed: Up to **54 Mbps**
- Range: ~35 meters
- Early adoption was limited due to higher cost

---

## 802.11b (Wi-Fi 2)

- Operates in the **2.4 GHz** band
- Speed: Up to **11 Mbps**
- Range: ~140 meters
- Widely adopted due to affordability and better range

---

## 802.11g (Wi-Fi 3)

- Operates in the **2.4 GHz** band
- Speed: Up to **54 Mbps**
- Range: ~140 meters
- Backward-compatible with 802.11b

---

## 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)

- Operates in **2.4 GHz** and **5 GHz** bands
- Speed: Up to **600 Mbps**
- Range: ~70–140 meters (depends on band)
- Introduced **MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output)**
  - Allows multiple antennas to send/receive simultaneously
  - Boosts performance and range

---

## 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)

- Operates in the **5 GHz** band
- Speed: Up to **6.9 Gbps**
- Introduced **MU-MIMO (Multi-User MIMO)**
  - Supports multiple devices simultaneously
  - Analogy:
    - **MIMO:** Like a hub (one at a time, but faster)
    - **MU-MIMO:** Like a switch (simultaneous users)

---

## 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6 / 6E)

- Operates in **2.4 GHz**, **5 GHz**, and **6 GHz** (Wi-Fi 6E)
- Speed: Up to **9.6 Gbps**
- Improved efficiency in high-density environments
- Backward-compatible with all earlier standards
- Supports:
  - **OFDMA** (splits channels for better efficiency)
  - **MU-MIMO** (uplink & downlink)
  - Better battery life for client devices

---

## Frequency Band Summary

- **2.4 GHz**: 802.11b, g, n, ax  
- **5 GHz**: 802.11a, n, ac, ax  
- **6 GHz**: 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6E only)

> ⚠️ Higher speeds often come with **reduced range** and **weaker wall penetration**
