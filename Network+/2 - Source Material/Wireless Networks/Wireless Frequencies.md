# Wireless Frequencies

Wireless networks use specific **frequency bands** to transmit and receive radio signals. Each band has its own strengths, limitations, and use cases.

---

## 2.4 GHz Band

- One of the most widely used wireless frequencies
- Known for:
  - **Longer range**
  - **Better wall penetration**
- Frequency range: **2.4 GHz to 2.495 GHz**
- Fewer available channels → **more interference**

### Channels

- Channels are the physical subdivisions of the frequency band used for communication
- In **2.4 GHz**, only **channels 1, 6, and 11** are **non-overlapping**
- Regulatory differences:
  - **North America:** Channels 1–11
  - **Europe:** Channels 1–13
  - **Japan:** Channels 1–14

---

## 5 GHz Band

- Frequency range: **5.725 GHz to 5.875 GHz**
- Offers:
  - **More bandwidth**
  - **Less interference**
  - **Higher throughput**
  - Shorter range than 2.4 GHz
- Up to **24 non-overlapping 20 MHz channels**

---

## 6 GHz Band (Wi-Fi 6E)

- Newer frequency band opened for Wi-Fi
- Frequency range: **5.925 GHz to 7.125 GHz**
- Provides:
  - **More channels**
  - **Wider bandwidth**
  - **Lower congestion**
  - **Very high-speed** short-range connections

---

## Channel Bonding

- Combines two or more adjacent channels into one **wider channel**
- Increases throughput by **increasing bandwidth** (e.g., 40, 80, or 160 MHz)
- Trade-off:
  - Fewer total available channels
  - **Increased risk of interference**

---

## Dynamic Wireless Features (802.11h)

### Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS)

- Monitors for **radar activity**
- If radar is detected, devices must **switch channels**
- Required in some 5 GHz ranges due to military or weather radar use

### Transmit Power Control (TPC)

- Devices automatically **adjust transmit power**
- Goal: Use the **minimum power** necessary to maintain a quality connection
- Reduces interference with neighboring networks

---

## Band Steering

- Intelligent feature that **distributes clients** across available frequency bands (e.g., 2.4 GHz vs 5 GHz)
- Helps prevent:
  - Overloading of the 2.4 GHz band
  - Underutilization of 5/6 GHz bands
- Improves overall **performance and load balancing**
