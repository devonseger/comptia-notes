# Power Distribution Systems

Power distribution in IT environments (like data centers and network closets) is essential for maintaining **uptime**, **equipment protection**, and **operational safety**.

---

## Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)

- Provides **emergency power** to devices when the main power fails
- Typically used for **short-term outages**
- Gives time to:
  - Safely shut down systems
  - Switch over to backup power sources (e.g., generator)
- Capacity depends on:
  - Size of the UPS
  - **Electrical load** (number of devices connected)

---

## Power Distribution Unit (PDU)

- A **rack-mounted device** that distributes AC power to servers, switches, and other equipment
- Often used in **server racks**
- Can include features like:
  - Surge protection
  - Load balancing
  - Monitoring (in intelligent PDUs)
- Protects against:
  - **Surges**
  - **Spikes**
  - **Brownouts**

---

## Generator

- Installed **outside of facilities**, often in **data centers**
- Kicks in during **longer-term power outages**
- Can keep systems online **for hours or days**, depending on fuel capacity
- Often works **in tandem with UPS systems**:
  - UPS bridges the gap while the generator starts up

---

## Managing Power Load

- Ensures that circuits are not **overloaded**
- Prevents:
  - Equipment damage
  - Tripped breakers
- Important for **power budgeting** and designing efficient data center racks

---

## Voltage

- Measured in **volts (V)** â€” it's the **electric potential difference**
- Many modern devices are **dual-voltage**:
  - Can be configured for **110V (North America)** or **220V (Europe and data centers)**
- Ensures compatibility across different power systems
