# Fire Suppression Systems

Fire suppression systems are crucial for protecting sensitive equipment in data centers and network infrastructure environments. The goal is to **extinguish fires quickly** while **minimizing damage to electronic equipment**.

---

## Wet Pipe Systems

- **Basic sprinkler system** — pipes are always filled with water
- Activates when heat causes a sprinkler head to open
- ⚠️ **Not recommended** for data centers or server rooms
  - Water can damage sensitive electronics more than the fire itself

---

## Pre-Action Systems

- Adds an extra layer of control compared to wet pipe systems
- Pipes are **dry** until the system is **pre-activated**
- Requires **two triggers**:
  1. Fire detection (e.g., smoke or heat)
  2. Individual sprinkler activation
- Helps prevent **accidental water release**

---

## Special Suppression Systems

- Use **clean agents** (gas-based) instead of water
- Examples: **FM-200**, **Inergen**, **CO₂**
- Suppresses fire by:
  - **Displacing oxygen**
  - **Interrupting chemical combustion**
- Must include:
  - **Alarm system** for detection
  - **Emergency oxygen** or **automatic evacuation** protocols
- Ideal for **server rooms, data centers**, and **telecom closets**
