# Cable Distribution Systems

A **cable distribution system** is the structured layout and organization of network cabling that ensures **efficient**, **reliable**, and **scalable** data communication. It connects the network backbone at the **Main Distribution Frame (MDF)** to the **Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF)** and then to **end-user wall jacks**.

---

## Cable Plant

Includes all physical components of a network's cabling infrastructure:

- Cables (copper or fiber)
- Wall jacks
- Patch panels
- Distribution frames (MDF, IDF)
- Racks, trays, conduit

---

## Demarcation Point

- The **boundary** between the ISP’s responsibility and the organization’s internal network
- Often a plastic box outside a home or a mounted interface in a business network closet

---

## Distribution Frames

### Main Distribution Frame (MDF)

- Central hub for all **internal network cabling**
- Connects to external circuits (like the ISP line)
- Usually located in the **main telecom room**

### Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF)

- Connects to the MDF via **horizontal or vertical cabling**
- Distributes connectivity to a specific **floor, wing, or section** of a building
- Multiple IDFs may connect back to a single MDF

---

## Cable Tray

- **Physical raceways** that organize and support cable runs throughout a building
- **Horizontal runs:** above ceilings or under floors  
- **Vertical runs:** between floors, often as **vertical cross-connects**
- Maintains cable management and reduces strain or EMI exposure

---

## Racks

Used to mount and organize networking hardware in a secure and accessible way.

### 2-Post Rack

- Two vertical rails
- Suitable for lighter equipment (patch panels, switches)
- Common in telco environments

### 4-Post Rack

- Provides support on all sides
- More stable and secure
- Ideal for heavier gear like servers and UPS units

### Wall-Mounted Rack

- Mounted directly to the wall
- Space-saving, perfect for small offices or IDF closets

### Full Cabinet Rack (Rack Enclosure)

- Enclosed with doors and side panels
- Offers physical security, airflow control, and dust protection
- Best for **critical or high-value equipment**

---

## Patch Panel

- A panel that **routes network connections** from wall jacks to network equipment
- Allows for convenient testing, organizing, and changing cable routes

#### Front Side
- Standard **RJ-45 jacks** (for patch cables)

#### Back Side
- **110 punchdown block** (for permanent cable terminations)

---

## 110 Block

- A type of punchdown block used in **Cat 5 and newer copper applications**
- Wall jacks should always terminate to a **patch panel** using 110 blocks — **best practice**

---

## Fiber Distribution Panel

- Designed for **fiber optic cable connections**
- Uses fiber connectors like:
  - **SC, LC, ST, MTRJ**
- Works like a **coupler** or **converter**
  - May convert from one fiber connector type to another
- Unlike a 110 block, fiber panels are **non-punchdown** — they’re plug-based and handle fragile fiber carefully
