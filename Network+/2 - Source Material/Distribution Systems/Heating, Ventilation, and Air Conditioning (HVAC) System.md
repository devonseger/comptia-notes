# Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) System

An HVAC system provides **temperature control**, **humidity regulation**, and **airflow management** to ensure **optimal operating conditions** for IT environments like data centers and network closets.

---

## Temperature Control

- Critical for preventing **overheating** in network equipment
- Most hardware generates significant heat during operation
- Devices often include **thermal failsafes** to shut down or throttle when overheating
- Recommended ambient temperature range:
  - **68째F to 77째F (20째C to 25째C)**

---

## Humidity

- Refers to the **concentration of water vapor** in the air
- Imbalance can lead to:
  - **Too much:** Condensation, which can damage electronic components
  - **Too little:** Increased risk of **electrostatic discharge (ESD)**
- Ideal range:
  - **40% to 60% relative humidity**

## Airflow Management

# port side exhaust

- Proper airflow ensures **cool air reaches intakes** and hot air is effectively exhausted
- Most network/server equipment uses **front-to-back** airflow:
  - Front = Cold air intake  
  - Back = Hot air exhaust

### Hot Aisle / Cold Aisle Configuration

- Racks are arranged in alternating rows:
  - **Cold aisle:** Equipment fronts face each other (intake)
  - **Hot aisle:** Equipment backs face each other (exhaust)
- Prevents hot air from recirculating into equipment intakes
