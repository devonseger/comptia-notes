## Key Concepts

### Data Locality
- Refers to the **geographic location** where data is **stored and processed**.
- Important because:
  - Some countries **mandate** that specific types of data (e.g., personal, financial, health data) must remain **within national borders**.
  - Affects **risk assessments** and **risk management** during cloud adoption and global network planning.

  - **Segmenting** cardholder data environments from the rest of the network.
  - **Encrypting** transmission of cardholder data.
  - **Regular security testing** and monitoring.

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

- Applies to organizations handling the personal data of individuals **in the EU and European Economic Area (EEA)**.
- Emphasizes:
  - Individual rights over personal data
  - Breach notification within 72 hours
  - Heavy penalties for non-compliance

  - **Periodic audits** to verify adherence to policies and regulations
- Compliance is crucial for:
  - Protecting data
