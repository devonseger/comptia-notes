# Threats and Vulnerabilities

Understanding the concepts of threats, vulnerabilities, and risks is fundamental to assessing and protecting network environments.

---

## Core Definitions

### Threat
- A **person, event, or action** that has the potential to **negatively impact** a valuable resource.
- Can be intentional (hacker) or unintentional (natural disaster).

### Vulnerability
- A **weakness** or **flaw** within a system, resource, or environment that can be **exploited** by a threat.
- Examples: outdated software, unlocked doors, lack of employee training.

### Risk
- **Risk = Threat Ã— Vulnerability**
- The likelihood that a threat will successfully exploit a vulnerability.

---

## Types of Threats

### Internal Threat
- Originates **within the organization**.
- Example: Disgruntled employees, insider sabotage, accidental damage.

### External Threat
- Originates **outside the organization**.
- Example: Hackers, malware attacks, or environmental disasters like floods.

---

## Types of Vulnerabilities

### Environmental Vulnerability
- Weaknesses related to the **physical surroundings**.
- Examples:  
  - Data center located in a flood zone  
  - No climate controls (excessive heat/humidity)

### Physical Vulnerability
- Weaknesses related to the **building security** itself.
- Examples:  
  - Unlocked server rooms  
  - Lack of CCTV surveillance

### Operational Vulnerability
- Weaknesses in **organizational processes and policies**.
- Examples:  
  - No user security training  
  - No incident response plan

### Technical Vulnerability
- Weaknesses in **software, hardware, or systems**.
- Examples:  
  - Unpatched operating systems  
  - Default passwords on devices

---

## Specialized Terms

### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
- A **public database** of **known security vulnerabilities**.
- Helps organizations track and prioritize patching.

### Zero-Day Vulnerability
- A **previously unknown vulnerability** that has **no patch available**.
- Highly dangerous because it is unknown to the software vendor or defenders.

### Exploit
- A **piece of code, software, or technique** designed to **take advantage of a vulnerability**.
- Can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise.

## Network+ Key Takeaways
- **Threats** are external or internal actors/events
- **Vulnerabilities** are weaknesses waiting to be exploited
- **Risk** combines both
- **Zero-day** = No defense yet available
- Know the difference between **physical**, **environmental**, **technical**, and **operational** vulnerabilities
