# Risk Management

Risk management involves the **identification, assessment, and mitigation** of risks that could negatively impact an organization's assets, systems, or operations.

---

## Types of Risk Assessments

### Risk Assessment
- General process to **identify potential hazards** and **analyze possible outcomes** if those hazards occur.

### Security Risk Assessment
- Specifically focuses on **identifying, assessing, and implementing** key security controls across applications, systems, or networks.

---

## Specialized Assessments

### Threat Assessment
- Focused on **identifying potential threats** that could attack or harm systems or networks.
- Example: Identifying possible threat actors like insiders, hackers, natural disasters.

### Vulnerability Assessment
- Focused on **identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities** within a system or network.
- Example: Scanning for outdated software, weak passwords, or misconfigurations.

### Penetration Test (Pen Test)
- Simulates **real-world attacks** by actively attempting to **exploit vulnerabilities**.
- Objective: Safely determine how an attacker could breach the system and what data or controls would be exposed.

### Posture Assessment
- Evaluates the **overall security stance** of an organization.
- Assesses the organization’s **attack surface** and ability to defend against threats.

## Business and Process Assessments

### Business Risk Assessment
- Identifies, understands, and evaluates **potential hazards** to business operations, people, and assets.
- Broader than just IT — may include physical safety, supply chain risks, etc.

### Process Assessment
- A **disciplined evaluation** of an organization's **processes** against a set of best practices, standards, or policies.
- Example: Auditing change management procedures.

### Vendor Assessment
- Evaluates **third-party vendors** to ensure they can:
  - Meet the business’s needs
  - Maintain required security standards
  - Reduce supply chain and partnership risks

## Network+ Key Takeaways
- **Risk Assessment** = general hazard identification
- **Security Risk Assessment** = security-specific hazard identification
- **Threat Assessment** = focus on actors/events
- **Vulnerability Assessment** = focus on system weaknesses
- **Penetration Test** = active exploitation testing
- **Posture Assessment** = organization’s security "health check"
- **Vendor Assessment** = evaluates third-party partners
