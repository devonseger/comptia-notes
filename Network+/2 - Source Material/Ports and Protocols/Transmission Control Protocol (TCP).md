# Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** is a fundamental protocol within the Internet Protocol suite that consists of a set of rules governing the exchange of data.

- **Reliable transmission:**  
  TCP ensures reliable transmission of data by breaking down larger messages into smaller packets.

- **Three-Way Handshake:**
  - **SYN**
  - **SYN-ACK**
  - **ACK**

- **Ordering:**  
  TCP uses sequence numbers and acknowledgements to ensure data is received in the correct order.

- **Flow Control:**  
  Prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver.

- **Windowing:**  
  Allows the receiver to specify the amount of data it can handle at one time.

## Port

A **port** is a numerical identifier used in TCP/IP and other network protocols that helps distinguish between different services or applications running on a device.
