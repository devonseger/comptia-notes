# Cloud Service Models

---

## On-Premise Solution
- The organization owns and maintains **all infrastructure**
- Responsible for:
  - Hardware
  - Software
  - Security
  - Data centers
  - Personnel
- Offers **maximum control**, but also the **highest cost and complexity**

## Hosted Solution
- Cloud infrastructure is **owned and maintained by a third-party provider**
- Organization rents services such as storage, servers, or apps
- Ideal for reducing physical infrastructure costs

## Cloud Service Models (NIST / Network+)

| Model | Definition | Examples | Consumer Responsibility |
|-------|------------|----------|--------------------------|
| **SaaS**<br>(Software as a Service) | Provides **fully managed applications** | Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Dropbox | Just use the app; no infrastructure or platform control |
| **PaaS**<br>(Platform as a Service) | Provides a **development environment** including OS, databases, and dev tools | Heroku, Google App Engine, Azure App Service | Focuses on deploying code; no OS or hardware concerns |
| **IaaS**<br>(Infrastructure as a Service) | Provides **virtualized hardware** like servers, storage, and networking | AWS EC2, Azure VM, Google Compute Engine | Consumer manages OS, apps, and data; provider manages hardware |

---

## Network+ Key Points:
- **SaaS** = ready-to-use apps (user responsibility is minimal)
- **PaaS** = platform to deploy your own code (you manage apps)
- **IaaS** = raw virtual machines (you manage OS and everything above)
- Hosted and on-premises describe **deployment**, not service models
