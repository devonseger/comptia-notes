# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources over the internet with benefits such as scalability, flexibility, high availability, and cost efficiency.

---

## Key Cloud Characteristics

### High Availability
- Services remain **continuously accessible with minimal downtime**
- Measured as a percentage (e.g., **"five nines" = 99.999% uptime**)
  - Downtime: ~5 minutes, 15 seconds/year
- Achieved via **redundancy**, **load balancing**, and **failover systems**

### Scalability
- The ability to **increase system capacity** to meet growing demand

#### Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)
- **Adding more power** to existing resources (e.g., more CPU, RAM)
- Upgrades a single server or VM

#### Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)
- **Adding more instances** or systems to share the load (e.g., more web servers)
- Common in distributed environments

### Rapid Elasticity
- The ability to **automatically scale resources up or down** in response to demand
- Appears “infinite” to the consumer

### Metered Utilization
- **Pay-per-use** pricing model (e.g., hourly billing, per-GB data transfer)
- Promotes cost efficiency

### Shared Resources
- Multiple customers (tenants) share **common physical infrastructure**
- Virtualization allows for **multi-tenancy**

### File Synchronization
- Files are **replicated across multiple devices or cloud servers**
- Ensures consistency and availability
- Common in tools like **Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive**

## Network+ Key Takeaways:
- Know the difference between **scalability** and **elasticity**
- Understand **vertical vs horizontal scaling**
- **Metered use** and **resource pooling** are essential cloud concepts
- High availability = **"five nines" uptime**
- File sync is used for **availability and collaboration**
