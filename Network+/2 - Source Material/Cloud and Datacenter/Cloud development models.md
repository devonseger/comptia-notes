# Cloud Deployment Models

Defines how cloud services are **deployed and accessed** by users and organizations.

---

## Public Cloud
- Infrastructure is hosted by a **third-party provider**
- Accessible over the **internet**
- Resources are **shared** between customers
- **Cost-effective** and highly scalable
- Examples: Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud

## Private Cloud
- Infrastructure is **dedicated to a single organization**
- Can be on-premises or hosted by a third party
- Provides **greater control and security**
- Higher cost than public cloud

## Hybrid Cloud
- Combines **public and private cloud** environments
- Allows movement of data/applications between environments
- Balances **security and scalability**
- Common use case: sensitive data in private cloud, less critical services in public cloud

## Community Cloud
- **Shared infrastructure** between organizations with **common concerns**
- Example: healthcare, government, or education consortiums
- Cost and resources are shared

---

# Cloud Tenancy Models

Defines **how resources are allocated** to users/customers within a cloud infrastructure.

---

## Multi-Tenancy
- **Multiple customers** share the same physical infrastructure
- Each tenantâ€™s data and workloads are **logically isolated**
- Offers **greater efficiency and lower cost**
- Introduces **security concerns** (data separation must be enforced)

## Single Tenancy
- Resources are **dedicated to a single organization**
- Offers **more control and security**
- **Less efficient** and typically **more expensive**

---

# Network+ Key Takeaways
- Public = cost-effective, but shared and internet-facing  
- Private = more secure, but costlier  
- Hybrid = flexible mix of both  
- Community = shared among similar organizations  
- Multi-tenancy = more common in public cloud (with isolation)  
- Single tenancy = more secure, but higher cost and overhead
