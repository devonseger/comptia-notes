# Fiber Network Connections

Most fiber cables require **two connectors** — one for **transmit (TX)** and one for **receive (RX)**. Some manufacturers bundle **paired fiber cores** into a single jacket for convenience.

## Common Fiber Connectors

### SC – **Subscriber Connector**
- **Square-shaped**, **push-pull** style
- Easy to insert and remove
- Durable and widely used
- Often used in **datacom and telecom**

### LC – **Lucent Connector**
- **Smaller** form factor than SC
- Also uses **push-pull** connection
- Compact and high-density — common in **switches**, **SFP modules**, and **data centers**

### ST – **Straight Tip**
- **Round** body with **twist-lock bayonet-style** mechanism
- Developed by AT&T
- Often used in **multimode fiber** and **outdoor applications**

### MTRJ – **Mechanical Transfer-Registered Jack**
- Small, **rectangular** connector
- Houses both **transmit and receive fibers** in one connector
- Similar to **RJ-style** connectors
- Cost-effective and good for **compact installs**

### MPO – **Multi-Fiber Push On**
- High-density connector supporting **12, 24, or more fibers** in a single plug
- Ideal for:
  - **Data centers**
  - **Backbone cabling**
  - **Parallel optics**
- Enables fast setup and mass connectivity

## Connector Polish Types

### PC – **Physical Contact**
- Slight curvature in connector face
- Reduces back reflection compared to flat polish
- Basic polish — **least effective** among the 3

### UPC – **Ultra Physical Contact**
- More refined **domed endface**
- Less back reflection than PC
- Common in most **modern fiber connections**

### APC – **Angled Physical Contact**
- Endface polished at an **8° angle**
- **Lowest back reflection**
- Used in **high-performance and long-haul fiber** installations
- Often recognized by **green connector housing**

| LC        | Push-pull     | Compact   | SFPs, switches, high-density|
| ST        | Twist-lock    | Round     | Multimode, outdoor         |
| MTRJ      | RJ-style clip | Compact   | Dual fiber in one plug     |
| MPO       | Push-pull     | High-density | Data centers, backbone |

| Polish Type | Shape      | Reflection | Use Case                        |
|-------------|------------|------------|---------------------------------|
| PC          | Slight curve | Moderate   | Legacy systems                  |
| UPC         | Domed       | Low        | Standard fiber links            |
| APC         | 8° angle    | Very Low   | Long-distance / high precision  |
