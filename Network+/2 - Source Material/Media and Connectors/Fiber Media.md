# Fiber Media

**Fiber optic cables** transmit data using **light** rather than electrical signals, offering advantages in **speed**, **distance**, and **immunity to interference**.

---

## Advantages

- **Immune to EMI** – Ideal for industrial or electrically noisy environments
- **Long distances** – Can span **hundreds of miles**
- **High speeds** – Typically supports **10 Gbps to 100+ Gbps**
- **High bandwidth** – Ideal for backbone infrastructure and data centers

---

## Drawbacks

- **Cost** – Cables and equipment are **more expensive** than copper
- **Complexity** – Installation, splicing, and maintenance are **more difficult**
  - Requires specialized tools and trained technicians

## Fiber Types

### Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)

- **Long-distance** communication (up to 100 km or more without repeaters)
- **Core size:** ~8.3 to 10 microns
- **Uses:**  
  - Telecom backbone  
  - Inter-building links  
  - High-speed WANs

- **Color sheath:** Typically **yellow**
- **Laser-based** light source

### Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)

- Optimized for **shorter distances** (up to ~2 km, often less)
- **Core size:** ~50 to 100 microns
- **Uses:**  
  - Intra-building networking  
  - Data centers  
  - LAN backbones

- **Color sheath:** Typically **orange** (OM1/OM2) or **aqua/blue** (OM3/OM4)
- **LED-based** light source

## Quick Reference Table

| Fiber Type | Core Size     | Distance     | Light Source | Sheath Color | Use Case                    |
|------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| SMF        | 8.3–10 μm     | Long (up to 100+ km) | Laser         | Yellow        | Long-haul, backbone, WAN    |
| MMF        | 50–100 μm     | Short (up to ~2 km) | LED           | Orange / Aqua | Data centers, LANs         |
