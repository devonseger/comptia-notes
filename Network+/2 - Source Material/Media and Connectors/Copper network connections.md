# Copper Network Connections

Copper network connectors serve as standardized interfaces that ensure compatibility between cables and devices across voice, video, and data transmission applications.

---

## Registered Jack (RJ-X)

- A **standardized telecommunication interface** for connecting voice/data equipment
- The "X" is replaced by a number (e.g., RJ-45, RJ-11)

### RJ-11
- Standard for **telephone wiring**
- **6-position 2-conductor** configuration (6P2C)
- Small and ideal for analog voice
- **Not suitable** for high-speed data transmission

### RJ-45
- Standard for **Ethernet and data networks**
- **8-position 8-conductor** configuration (8P8C)
- Used with:
  - Cat 5, 5e, 6, 6a, 7, and 8 cables
- Connects devices in **LANs**
- Physically larger than RJ-11
- Supports speeds up to **10+ Gbps**

## Radio Guide (RG-X)

- Naming convention for **coaxial cables**
- Used in TV, radio, and broadband internet

### RG-6
- Modern coax standard for:
  - **Digital TV**
  - **Cable modems**
  - **Satellite systems**
- Supports higher bandwidth and frequency
- Typically paired with **F-type connectors**

### RG-59
- Older coax spec used in analog:
  - **TV**
  - **CCTV**
  - **Radio**
- Lower bandwidth, shorter range

## Connector Types

### F-Type
- **Screw-on** coaxial connector
- Standard for:
  - **Cable TV**
  - **Satellite**
  - **Cable internet**
- Typically used with **RG-6**

### BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman)
- Coaxial connector with **bayonet-style twist-lock**
- Used in:
  - **CCTV systems**
  - **Analog video**
  - Some older network hardware
- Common in lab/test environments
- ⚠️ *Not* British Naval Connector (common misconception)
