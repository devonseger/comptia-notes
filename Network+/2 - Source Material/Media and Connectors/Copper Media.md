# Copper Media

Copper has been the **default cable type in networks** for decades due to its cost-effectiveness and ease of installation.

---

## IEEE 802.3 Standard

Defines the **physical layer** and **data link layer (MAC)** for **wired Ethernet networks**.

---

## Twisted Pair Cabling

Two conductors of a circuit are twisted together to **reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI)** and **crosstalk**.

### Types:

- **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)**  
  - No additional shielding  
  - Lightweight, flexible, and cost-effective  
  - Common in most Ethernet networks

- **Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)**  
  - Includes additional shielding (foil/braided)  
  - Reduces EMI further  
  - Useful in industrial or high-interference environments

## Ethernet Cable Categories

| Category | Speed         | Max Distance | Frequency | Standard        |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Cat 5    | 100 Mbps      | 100 meters   | 100 MHz   | 100BASE-T       |
| Cat 5e   | 1 Gbps        | 100 meters   | 100 MHz   | 1000BASE-T      |
| Cat 6    | 1 Gbps        | 100 meters   | 250 MHz   | 10GBASE-T (shorter distances) |
| Cat 6a   | 10 Gbps       | 100 meters   | 500 MHz   | 10GBASE-T       |
| Cat 7    | 10 Gbps       | 100 meters   | 600 MHz   | 10GBASE-T (not TIA-approved) |
| Cat 8    | Up to 50 Gbps | 30 meters    | 2 GHz     | Data centers, high-speed short runs |

## Coaxial Cable

**Single copper conductor** core, surrounded by insulation and shielding.

- **RG-6**  
  - Used for cable modems  
  - Higher bandwidth (up to 1 Gbps)  
  - Range: ~300 meters

- **RG-59**  
  - Older standard  
  - Used for **analog video/CCTV**  
  - Lower bandwidth, shorter distances

## Specialized Copper Cabling

### Direct Attach Copper (DAC)
- Fixed copper assembly used for switch-to-switch or switch-to-server connections
- Common in data centers
- Uses **SFP+, QSFP, QSFP28** connectors
- Supports:
  - 10 Gbps
  - 40 Gbps
  - 100 Gbps (varies by length)

### Twinaxial Cable (Twinax)
- Commonly part of DAC cables
- Contains **two shielded conductors**
- More EMI-resistant than standard copper
- Often used with **SFP+ and QSFP** interfaces
- Supports:
  - 10 Gbps
  - 25 Gbps
  - 40 Gbps
  - 100 Gbps

## Plenum vs. Non-Plenum Rated Cabling

- **Plenum**  
  - Fire-retardant jackets (e.g., low-smoke PVC)  
  - Used in air-handling spaces (e.g., above ceiling tiles)  
  - Meets **NFPA** and **NEC** requirements

- **Non-Plenum**  
  - Standard insulation  
  - **Not safe** for plenum spaces  
  - Cheaper but more hazardous in case of fire
