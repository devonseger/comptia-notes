# DNS Record Types and DNS Concepts

## DNS Record Types

|Record Type|Description|Function|
|---|---|---|
|**A**|Address Record|Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address|
|**AAAA**|IPv6 Address Record|Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address|
|**CNAME**|Canonical Name (Alias) Record|Points one domain to another domain name|
|**MX**|Mail Exchange Record|Specifies email servers responsible for accepting mail|
|**NS**|Name Server Record|Identifies authoritative DNS servers for a domain|
|**PTR**|Pointer Record|Maps an IP address to a domain name (reverse DNS lookup)|
|**SOA**|Start of Authority Record|Indicates authoritative information about a DNS zone|
|**SRV**|Service Locator Record|Defines the location (host and port number) of servers for specified services|
|**TXT**|Text Record|Holds arbitrary text information, often used for verification and security (e.g., SPF, DKIM records)|

## Additional DNS Concepts

### Zone Transfer

- Transfers DNS records from a primary DNS server to a secondary DNS server.
    
- Uses TCP protocol due to its reliable data transfer capabilities.
    

### Reverse DNS Lookup

- Resolves IP addresses to domain names.
    
- Typically stored under the `.arpa` top-level domain.
    
- Example format: `66.55.44.33.in-addr.arpa`
    

### Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)

- First network to implement the foundational protocols that evolved into the modern Internet.
    
- Established `.arpa` as the first top-level domain.
    

### Forward DNS Lookup

- Standard DNS operation resolving domain names to IP addresses.
    

### Internal DNS

- Facilitates internal network resolution within private or cloud environments.
    
- Allows instances within the same network to access each other using internal DNS names.
    

### External DNS

- DNS records managed by central authorities and publicly accessible.
    
- Used to resolve domain names on the public Internet.
    

### Time to Live (TTL)

- Indicates how long DNS resolvers should cache a DNS response.
    
- After TTL expires, a new DNS query must be initiated.
    

### DNS Resolver / DNS Cache

- Maintains a local copy of DNS queries and responses.
    
- Improves resolution speed by reducing repeated external queries.
    

### Recursive Lookup

- DNS server fully resolves the query by interacting with other DNS servers.
    
- Ultimately returns the resolved IP address directly to the client.
    

### Iterative Lookup

- DNS servers progressively guide clients by referring them to other DNS servers until the authoritative server is reached.
    
- Each server provides partial information, directing the client toward resolution.
