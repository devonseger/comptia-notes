# Network Time Protocol (NTP)

Network Time Protocol (NTP) - 
	Synchronizes clocks between systems communicating over a packet-switched, variable-latency data network. Sent over udp using port 123.

Stratum - 

Client - 

Servers - 

Precision Time Protocol -
	Used to synchronize clocks throughout a computer network, ideal for networks that require precision time keeping. Operates using a primary secondary architecture 

Network Time Security - 
	Extension of ntp that was developed to provide cryptographic security for the time sync provided by the ntp servers. nts uses both tls and AEAD to ensure time sync is secure and the time source is authenticated
