Welcome to my personal study notes for the **CompTIA Network+ (N10-009)** and **Security+ (SY0-701)** certifications. These notes are organized using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and cover a wide range of topics relevant to each exam objective.

## üìÅ Structure

- `Network+` - Notes for N10-009 covering networking fundamentals, protocols, ports, OSI model, subnetting, wireless, troubleshooting, and more.
- `Security+` - Notes for SY0-701 covering threats, vulnerabilities, risk management, secure protocols, identity, incident response, and more.
- `5 - Templates` - Personal Obsidian templates for note-taking (excluded from version control).
- `.obsidian/` - Obsidian configuration files (excluded from version control).

## ‚úÖ About the Notes

I personally wrote these notes while studying, but **used AI tools** to:

- Perform spell checks
- Reformat sections for clarity and readability
- Generate summaries or examples in some places

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: These notes are not official materials and should not be treated as such. While I've made every effort to ensure accuracy, **please verify critical concepts with trusted sources** like the official CompTIA objectives or instructor-led courses.
