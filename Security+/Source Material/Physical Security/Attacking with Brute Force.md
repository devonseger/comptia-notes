# Attacking with Brute Force
### Brute Force

An attack method that involves trying all possible options until successful access is achieved.

---

### Physical Brute Force Techniques:

- **Forcible Entry**  
    Unauthorized access by physically breaking through barriers such as doors, windows, or fences.
    
- **Tampering with Security Devices**  
    Manipulating or disabling alarms, sensors, or locks to introduce exploitable vulnerabilities.  
    **Mitigation:** Use redundancy in security systems (e.g., cameras + alarms + physical locks).
    
- **Confronting Security Personnel**  
    Directly engaging or distracting guards to bypass protections.  
    **Countermeasures:** Train staff in conflict resolution and self-defense; enable rapid communication for support.
    
- **Vehicle Ramming**  
    Using a motor vehicle to break through gates, bollards, or other barriers.  
    **Prevention:** Reinforced bollards, vehicle traps, and crash-rated gates.
