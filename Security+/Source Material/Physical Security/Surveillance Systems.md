# Surveillance Systems

Used to maintain security and safety in facilities such as businesses, homes, and public areas.

### Overview

- **Surveillance System**  
    An organized strategy or setup designed to observe and report activities in a defined area.
    
- **Video Surveillance**  
    Features: Motion detection, night vision, facial recognition, remote access.  
    **Benefits:** Real-time monitoring and post-incident review of recorded footage.
    
- **Security Guards**  
    Flexible, human-based surveillance. Helps reassure staff/customers and respond dynamically to threats.
    
- **Lighting**  
    Crucial for effective video monitoring and enhancing guard visibility in low-light environments.

### Sensors

Devices that detect and respond to environmental changes, converting them into readable signals:

- **Infrared Sensors**  
    Detect changes in infrared radiation emitted by warm bodies (e.g., humans, animals).
    
- **Pressure Sensors**  
    Triggered when a specified weight is applied (e.g., embedded in floors or mats).
    
- **Microwave Sensors**  
    Emit microwave pulses and detect movement by analyzing reflected signals.
    
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**  
    Use sound waves to detect motion by measuring the reflection of high-frequency waves off objects.
