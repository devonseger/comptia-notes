# Access Control Vestibules

Access control vestibules (also called security mantraps or airlocks) use a **double-door system** where only **one door can open at a time**, electronically controlled. These systems:

- Help enforce **strict access control**
    
- Prevent **unauthorized entry**
    
- Provide a **buffer zone** between secured and unsecured areas
    

### Common Attack Methods

- **Piggybacking**  
    A person with legitimate access **knowingly allows** an unauthorized individual to enter alongside them.
    
- **Tailgating**  
    An unauthorized individual **follows** someone into a secure area **without their knowledge**.
    

### Purpose

- Enforces **physical access policies**
    
- Helps detect and prevent **unauthorized entry attempts**
    
- Adds **redundancy** to standard card readers or biometric authentication systems
