# Bypassing Surveillance Systems

Methods threat actors may use to evade or disable surveillance:

### Techniques

- **Visual Obstruction**  
    Blocking the camera’s line of sight using physical objects or environmental manipulation.
    
- **Blinding Sensors and Cameras**  
    Using a sudden burst of light (e.g., laser pointer or flashlight) to overwhelm image sensors temporarily.
    
- **Acoustic Interference**  
    Playing loud sounds or using jamming equipment to disrupt microphones or audio surveillance.
    
- **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)**  
    Jamming or disrupting the wireless signals that cameras and sensors use for transmission or control.
    
- **Physical Environment Exploits**  
    Leveraging the surrounding area (e.g., hiding behind objects, exploiting blind spots) to avoid detection.
    
- **Physical Tampering**  
    Direct interference such as cutting wires, disabling cameras, or damaging infrastructure.

### Modern Countermeasures

- **Tamper Alarms** – Alert when equipment is physically moved, blocked, or damaged.
    
- **Backup Power / UPS** – Prevents downtime from power loss.
    
- **Encrypted Frequencies** – Defends against signal interception or jamming.
