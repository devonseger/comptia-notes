# Door Locks

### Overview

**Door locks** are a type of **physical security control** used to restrict and regulate access to secured areas. They are a first line of defense in preventing unauthorized physical access to facilities, rooms, or systems.

### Types of Door Locks

#### **1. Padlocks**

- Typically use a **pin-and-tumbler** mechanism
    
- Considered **low security** — easy to pick, cut, or bypass
    
- Common for temporary or low-value security applications
    

#### **2. Cipher Locks (Mechanical Keypad Locks)**

- **Push-button code-based** locking system
    
- No need for a physical key
    
- Often used for interior doors (e.g., server rooms, storage closets)
    
- Vulnerability arises from shoulder surfing or code sharing
    

#### **3. Electronic Door Locks**

Use technology to enhance access control:

- **PIN-based** input
    
- **Biometrics** (fingerprint, retina, facial recognition)
    
- **Wireless signal-based** access (e.g., NFC, RFID, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi)
    

> Many electronic locks support **multi-factor authentication** (MFA) for added security.

### Biometrics as an Authentication Factor

- Classified as an **inherence factor** (something you are)
    
- Common biometric inputs: fingerprint, palm print, retina scan, iris scan, facial recognition, voice
    

#### Challenges with Biometrics:

|Term|Description|
|---|---|
|**False Acceptance Rate (FAR)**|The probability that an unauthorized person is incorrectly accepted as valid|
|**False Rejection Rate (FRR)**|The probability that an authorized person is incorrectly denied access|
|**Crossover Error Rate (CER)**|Also called **Equal Error Rate (EER)** – the point where FAR and FRR are equal. Lower CER = better performance and accuracy|

> **Goal:** Lower both FAR and FRR while balancing usability  
> Increasing sensitivity may reduce FAR, but it can increase FRR

### Security Considerations

- **Multi-factor locks** (e.g., requiring a PIN + biometric) greatly improve security
    
- **Interior access** is often the point of **real vulnerability** — once a perimeter is breached, less-secure internal areas may be exposed
    
- **Not all locks offer the same level of protection** — physical strength, tamper resistance, and access logging features vary
