# Hacktivists

Hacktivists are individuals or groups who use hacking techniques to promote political, social, or ideological causes, rather than for personal or financial gain.

### Common Tactics

- **Website Defacement** – Digital vandalism; replacing a website’s content with propaganda or messages supporting their cause.
    
- **DDoS Attacks** – Distributed denial-of-service attacks using botnets to overwhelm networks, making them inaccessible to legitimate users.
    
- **Doxing** – Public release of personally identifiable information (PII) about individuals or organizations.
    
- **Leaking Sensitive Data** – Similar to doxing but often involves internal or proprietary data belonging to organizations.
    

### Example

- **LulzSec**  
    A well-known hacktivist group responsible for high-profile attacks during their "50 Days of Lulz" campaign.  
    Notable targets included the **CIA**, **FBI**, **Sony**, **Nintendo**, and **News Corporation**.  
    Actions included password dumps, leaks, and website takedowns.
