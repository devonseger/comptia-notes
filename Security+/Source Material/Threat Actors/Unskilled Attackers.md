# Unskilled Attackers

Unskilled attackers—often referred to as **script kiddies**—lack the technical knowledge to develop their own hacking tools or exploits.

- They rely on pre-made tools and publicly available exploits (e.g., Metasploit modules, DDoS-for-hire services).
    
- Despite limited skill, they can still cause significant disruption, particularly by targeting systems with **unpatched vulnerabilities**.
    
- Their motivations are often based on recognition, curiosity, or the thrill of causing disruption—not typically financial gain or political ideology.
    
- They may be capable of actions such as **kicking a workstation off a network** or launching basic DDoS attacks.
    

**Example:**  
A script kiddie uses a free Wi-Fi jamming tool to knock nearby devices offline just for fun.
