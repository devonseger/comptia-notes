# Insider Threats

**Insider threats** are cybersecurity risks that originate from individuals **within the organization**, such as employees, contractors, or third-party partners.

These actors often have **legitimate access** to internal systems, which can make their actions harder to detect and more damaging.

### Types of Insider Threats

- **Data Theft** – Stealing proprietary or sensitive data for personal gain or competitive advantage.
    
- **Sabotage** – Deliberately harming systems, deleting data, or disrupting services to damage the organization.
    
- **Misuse of Access Privileges** – Using legitimate access to perform unauthorized or unethical actions.
    

### Common Motivations

1. **Financial Gain** – Selling sensitive data to competitors or on the dark web.
    
2. **Revenge** – Lashing out due to perceived mistreatment, layoffs, or disciplinary action.
    
3. **Negligence** – Unintentional actions resulting from poor security hygiene or lack of awareness.
    

> Effective mitigation includes implementing **least privilege access**, conducting **user activity monitoring**, and providing **regular cybersecurity awareness training**.
