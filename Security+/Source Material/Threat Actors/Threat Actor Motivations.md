# Threat Actor Motivations
> **Intent** defines _what_ an attacker does; **motivation** explains _why_ they do it.

### 1. **Data Exfiltration**

The unauthorized transfer of sensitive data from a system.

**Example**:  
_The 2013 Target breach_—Attackers exfiltrated payment card and personal data of over 40 million customers using stolen credentials from a third-party HVAC vendor.

---

### 2. **Blackmail**

Threat actors steal sensitive or compromising data and threaten to release it unless demands are met (e.g., payment).

**Example**:  
_The Ashley Madison breach (2015)_—Hackers released personal data of users from a dating site for extramarital affairs, leading to blackmail and extortion threats.

---

### 3. **Espionage**

Covertly gathering confidential information for intelligence purposes, often tied to nation-state actors.

**Example**:  
_The SolarWinds attack (2020)_—Attributed to Russian state-backed actors, it targeted U.S. government and corporate networks to spy on operations and gather intelligence.

---

### 4. **Service Disruption**

Aimed at denying access to legitimate users, usually via Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.

**Example**:  
_Dyn DNS DDoS attack (2016)_—Botnet-powered attack took down major services like Twitter, Reddit, and Netflix by overwhelming the DNS provider.

---

### 5. **Financial Gain**

The most common motivation—cybercriminals steal data, deploy ransomware, or conduct fraud to make money.

**Example**:  
_WannaCry ransomware (2017)_—Encrypted systems across 150 countries, demanding Bitcoin payments to restore access.

---

### 6. **Philosophical or Political Beliefs (Hacktivism)**

Driven by ideology; actors protest perceived injustices or promote political causes.

**Example**:  
_Anonymous_—A well-known hacktivist group that has targeted governments and corporations to protest censorship, police violence, and corruption.

---

### 7. **Ethical Reasons (White-Hat Hacking)**

Also known as authorized hackers, they aim to find and report vulnerabilities to improve security.

**Example**:  
_A researcher discovers a critical bug in Google Chrome_, responsibly discloses it, and receives a bounty through Google’s Vulnerability Reward Program.

---

### 8. **Revenge**

Motivated by personal grievances, often involving disgruntled employees.

**Example**:  
_A former IT admin for a medical company used his credentials post-termination to delete critical systems and data_ out of spite.

---

### 9. **Disruption or Chaos**

Unstructured attacks for entertainment, challenge, or notoriety. Often associated with script kiddies or gray-hat hackers.

**Example**:  
_Lizard Squad_—Disrupted Xbox Live and PlayStation Network during the 2014 holiday season, primarily for attention and challenge.

---

### 10. **War (Cyberwarfare)**

Nation-states use cyber tools to sabotage, disrupt, or gain advantage during geopolitical conflicts.

**Example**:  
_Russia’s NotPetya malware attack (2017)_—Initially targeting Ukraine, it quickly spread globally, crippling logistics, energy, and health industries.
