# Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces

### Threat Vector

A **threat vector** is the method or pathway used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a system to deliver a malicious payload or perform unwanted actions.

### Attack Surface

The **attack surface** includes all potential entry and exit points where an unauthorized user could interact with a system. Minimizing the attack surface reduces the number of exploitable vulnerabilities.

### Ways to Reduce the Attack Surface

- Restrict access to only what is necessary
    
- Remove unnecessary software
    
- Disable unused network protocols and services

### Common Threat Vectors

- **Messages** – Email, SMS, or instant messaging used in phishing and malware campaigns.
    
- **Images** – Malicious code embedded within image files (e.g., steganography attacks).
    
- **Files** – Files with embedded malware (e.g., macros in Word or PDF documents).
    
- **Voice Calls** – Social engineering through phone calls (e.g., vishing).
    
- **Removable Devices** – USB drives used to deliver malware or exfiltrate data.
    
- **Unsecure Networks** – Open or improperly secured networks that allow unauthorized access.

### Notable Bluetooth-Based Threat Vectors

- **BlueBorne** – A set of vulnerabilities in Bluetooth that allows attackers to take control of devices or spread malware wirelessly.
    
- **BlueSmack** – A Bluetooth denial-of-service (DoS) attack using oversized L2CAP packets.
