# Shadow IT

**Shadow IT** refers to the use of IT systems, devices, software, applications, and services **without explicit approval from the organization**.

### Common Examples

- Use of **personal devices** (BYOD) for work-related tasks.
    
- Installation of **unapproved software** or browser extensions.
    
- Use of **unauthorized cloud services** (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive).
    
- Connecting **external hardware** such as USB drives, external HDDs, network adapters, or other peripherals.
    

### Risks

- **Bypasses security controls**, introducing vulnerabilities.
    
- **Creates visibility gaps** for IT/security teams.
    
- May lead to **data loss**, **malware infections**, or **compliance violations**.
    
- Often arises when **official tools are too restrictive** or slow to adopt.
    

> Organizations can reduce shadow IT by maintaining flexible security policies, providing approved alternatives, and promoting user awareness.
