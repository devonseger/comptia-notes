- **Sophisticated Phishing Campaigns** – Highly targeted spear-phishing or social engineering to gain access or credentials.
    
- **Use of Anonymizing Tools** – Employ tools like cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Monero), the dark web (Tor), and cellular data sniffers to evade detection and attribution.
    

### Common Crimes

- **Data Breaches**
    
- **Identity Theft**
    
- **Online Fraud**
    
- **Large-scale Ransomware Attacks**
    

### Examples

- **Carbanak Group** – Responsible for stealing over **$1 billion** from banks worldwide by infiltrating financial systems and manipulating transactions.
