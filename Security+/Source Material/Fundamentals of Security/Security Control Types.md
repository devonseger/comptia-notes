# Security Control Types

Security controls are categorized by function to help identify how they contribute to overall protection.

---

### Preventative Controls

Proactive measures designed to stop security incidents before they occur.  
**Examples:** Firewalls, access control mechanisms, security awareness training

---

### Deterrent Controls

Discourage attackers by increasing the perceived risk or effort of an attack.  
**Examples:** Warning signs, login banners, security guards, surveillance systems

---

### Detective Controls

Identify and alert on suspicious activity as it happens or shortly after.  
**Examples:** Intrusion detection systems (IDS), security cameras, motion sensors, audit logs

---

### Corrective Controls

Minimize the impact of an incident and restore systems to normal.  
**Examples:** Antivirus quarantine, system patches, backups, restore points

---

### Compensating Controls

Alternative solutions used when primary controls are impractical or unavailable.  
**Examples:** Manual review procedures, physical oversight, third-party audits

---

### Directive Controls

Establish expected behavior and guide security practices through formal documentation.  
**Examples:** Acceptable Use Policies (AUP), standard operating procedures (SOPs), onboarding training
