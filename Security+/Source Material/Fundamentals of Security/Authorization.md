# Authorization

**Authorization** is the process of granting users or entities the appropriate permissions and privileges _after_ they have been authenticated.

### Key Concepts:

- **Purpose**: Determines what actions a user can perform, what data they can view or modify, and which systems or areas they can access.
    
- **Timing**: Occurs **after authentication** to ensure access is only granted to verified users.
    
- **Role in Security**: Acts as a _gatekeeper_ to enforce access controls and protect sensitive data and systems.
    

### Common Authorization Models:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Permissions are assigned based on a user’s role within the organization (e.g., admin, user, auditor).
    
- **Rule-Based Access Control** – Access is granted based on a defined set of rules (e.g., time of day, IP address).
    
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** – Makes decisions based on user attributes (e.g., department, clearance level), resource attributes, and environmental conditions.
    

### Summary:

Authorization ensures that **only the right people have the right access** to the right resources, maintaining security and enforcing organizational policies.
