# Security Control Categories

Security controls are classified into several categories, each addressing different aspects of an organizationâ€™s risk management strategy.

---

### Technical Controls

Technology-based safeguards that protect systems and data.

- Examples: Firewalls, encryption, access control lists (ACLs), intrusion detection systems (IDS)
    

---

### Managerial Controls

Governance-level policies and frameworks that guide security strategy and decision-making.

- Examples: Risk assessments, security planning, policies and procedures, compliance management
    

---

### Operational Controls

Procedures and practices carried out by personnel to maintain security on a daily basis.

- Examples: Security awareness training, incident response plans, account reviews, change management processes
    

---

### Physical Controls

Tangible mechanisms used to protect physical access to systems, facilities, and equipment.

- Examples: Locks, security guards, surveillance cameras, badge access systems

**Note:**  
A strong security posture involves layering these control types together to provide defense in depth and ensure both human and technical safeguards are in place.
