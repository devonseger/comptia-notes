### 🔍 Definitions

#### **Vulnerability**

A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system's design, implementation, or operation that could be exploited by a threat actor.  
**Examples:**

- Unpatched software (software bugs)
    
- Misconfigured services (e.g., open ports, default credentials)
    
- Inadequate network device protection
    
- Missing security updates/patches
    
- Poor or missing physical security (e.g., unlocked server rooms)

#### **Threat**

A **threat** is any circumstance or event that has the potential to negatively impact organizational operations or assets through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, or disruption.

### ⚖️ Risk Concepts

Risk occurs **only when both a threat and a vulnerability are present**.

- **Threat + No Vulnerability = No Risk**  
    _(The system is protected against that particular threat.)_
    
- **Vulnerability + No Threat = No Risk**  
    _(No one is currently attempting to exploit the weakness.)_
    
- **Lack of preparation** can itself be considered a vulnerability.
    
    - Example: Failing to schedule patching leaves systems exposed.  
        → _"Scheduling vulnerability"_

### 🔧 Risk Management

**Risk Management** is the practice of identifying, assessing, and reducing risks to acceptable levels.

- **Goals:**
    
    - Minimize the likelihood of undesired outcomes (e.g., breaches, data loss)
        
    - Achieve the organization’s security and business objectives
        
- **Key Concepts:**
    
    - **Risk Mitigation** – Reduce the severity of a risk
        
    - **Risk Acceptance** – Acknowledge risk without action (usually low-priority)
        
    - **Risk Transfer** – Shift risk to another party (e.g., cyber insurance)
        
    - **Risk Avoidance** – Eliminate the source of risk entirely
