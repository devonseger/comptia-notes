# Authentication

### Definition

**Authentication** is a security measure that ensures individuals or systems are **who they claim to be** during access, communication, or transactions. It is a foundational element of identity and access management (IAM).

### Authentication Factors

Authentication mechanisms are typically grouped into five categories known as **factors**:

1. **Something You Know**
    
    - A piece of information known only to the user
        
    - Examples: Passwords, PINs, passphrases, security questions
        
2. **Something You Have**
    
    - A physical device or token possessed by the user
        
    - Examples: Smart cards, hardware tokens, mobile phone (OTP apps like Google Authenticator)
        
3. **Something You Are**
    
    - Biometric characteristics that are unique to the user
        
    - Examples: Fingerprints, retina/iris scans, facial recognition
        
4. **Something You Do**
    
    - Behavioral biometrics based on actions
        
    - Examples: Typing rhythm, voice patterns, mouse movement
        
5. **Somewhere You Are**
    
    - Geolocation-based verification
        
    - Examples: IP address location, GPS data, time zone

### MFA vs. 2FA

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
    
    - Uses **exactly two** different factors from the list above
        
    - Example: Password (something you know) + Code from app (something you have)
        
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
    
    - Requires **two or more** factors
        
    - Improves security by making unauthorized access significantly more difficult
        
    - MFA â‰  using two methods from the same category (e.g., two passwords)

|Term|Description|
|---|---|
|Single-Factor Authentication|Uses only one method (e.g., just a password)|
|Strong Authentication|Typically includes MFA with well-secured individual methods|
|Authentication vs. Authorization|Authentication = who you are, Authorization = what you can access|
|Identity Provider (IdP)|System or service that verifies and stores identity credentials|
|One-Time Password (OTP)|Temporary password valid for one login session or transaction|
|Biometric Accuracy Metrics|Includes False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), and crossover error rate (CER)|
