# Gap Analysis
A **gap analysis** is a strategic process used to compare an organization's current performance with its desired objectives, highlighting deficiencies and areas for improvement.

### General Process:

1. **Define the Scope** – Determine what area(s) of the organization will be evaluated.
    
2. **Gather Data** – Collect information on the current state of infrastructure, processes, or performance.
    
3. **Analyze the Data** – Identify discrepancies or "gaps" between the current and desired state.
    
4. **Develop a Plan** – Create actionable steps to bridge those gaps.

### Types of Gap Analysis:

#### Technical Gap Analysis

Focuses on evaluating an organization's technical infrastructure and determining where it falls short in meeting the demands of its security or technology goals.  
**Example:** Outdated firewalls that can’t support modern threat detection.

#### Business Gap Analysis

Evaluates current business processes and identifies shortcomings that prevent effective use of solutions such as cloud computing.  
**Example:** A manual approval workflow that slows down deployment in a cloud-native CI/CD pipeline.

- Specific remediation actions
    
- Resource allocations
    
- Deadlines or timelines for completion

### Summary

A gap analysis is a foundational part of improving security posture and operational performance. It helps identify where security, infrastructure, or policy does not align with goals and compliance requirements.
