# Confidentiality

### Definition

**Confidentiality** refers to the protection of information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or exposure. It ensures that sensitive data is only accessible to individuals or systems with the proper authorization.

---

### Objectives of Confidentiality

- **Protect personal privacy**
    
- **Maintain business advantage**
    
- **Achieve regulatory compliance** (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS)
    

---

### Common Data Types Requiring Confidentiality

- **PII** (Personally Identifiable Information)  
    e.g., name, SSN, address, date of birth
    
- **PHI** (Protected Health Information)  
    e.g., medical records, insurance details
    
- **Financial Data**  
    e.g., credit card numbers, bank account information, tax returns

### Methods of Ensuring Confidentiality

- **Encryption**  
    Transforms data into an unreadable format unless decrypted by authorized entities.  
    Examples:
    
    - Symmetric encryption (e.g., AES)
        
    - Asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA)
        
- **Access Controls**  
    Restricts access based on user roles, permissions, and identity.
    
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
        
    - Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
        
    - Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
        
- **Data Masking**  
    Obscures specific data elements within a dataset to protect them from unauthorized access while preserving functionality for testing or analysis.
    
- **Physical Security Measures**  
    Controls access to hardware and physical storage:
    
    - Locked server rooms
        
    - Badge access systems
        
    - Surveillance cameras
        
- **Training and Awareness**  
    Regularly educating employees on:
    
    - Secure handling of sensitive data
        
    - Recognizing phishing and social engineering attacks
        
    - Following best practices for password security and workstation hygiene
