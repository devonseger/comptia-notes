# Preventing Phishing Attacks

Preventing phishing attacks requires a **multi-layered defense strategy**, combining **technical safeguards**, **user education**, and **organizational policies**. The goal is to reduce the likelihood of successful phishing attempts by **raising awareness** and improving **email hygiene practices**.

### Anti-Phishing Campaigns

**Anti-phishing campaigns** are structured efforts to educate users and test their awareness of phishing techniques. They typically include:

- **Security Awareness Training**
    
    - Covers the most common phishing techniques (e.g., spoofed email addresses, mismatched URLs, urgent requests).
        
    - Educates users on what phishing looks like and how to handle suspicious messages.
        
- **Phishing Simulations**
    
    - Send fake phishing emails internally to evaluate employee responses.
        
    - Identify high-risk users and provide **remedial training** to those who fall for simulated attacks.
        
- **Regular Refreshers**
    
    - Ongoing education is critical, as phishing tactics continue to evolve.

### Common Phishing Indicators to Train Users On

|Indicator|Description|
|---|---|
|**Generic Greetings**|Phishing emails often use vague greetings like "Dear user" or "Dear customer" instead of personalized names.|
|**Spelling and Grammar Errors**|Multiple typos, awkward phrasing, or poor grammar often indicate fraudulent messages.|
|**Spoofed or Unusual Email Addresses**|Always verify the sender’s actual address, not just the display name.|
|**Urgency or Threats**|Messages that insist on “immediate action” or threaten account lockouts are red flags.|
|**Unusual Requests**|Be wary of emails requesting login credentials, bank details, or wire transfers.|
|**Mismatched URLs**|Hover over links to verify the true destination. The visible text may differ from the actual URL (common in HTML emails).|
|**Strange Attachments**|Attachments from unknown or suspicious sources can contain malware or ransomware.|

### Technical Defenses (Optional but Recommended to Include)

- **Email Filtering and Security Gateways**  
    Detect and block known phishing domains or suspicious payloads.
    
- **Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DKIM, and DMARC**  
    Prevent domain spoofing by verifying email authenticity.
    
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
    Mitigates the risk of credential compromise in case a phishing attempt is successful.
    
- **Browser/Endpoint Protections**  
    Flag and block known malicious links and attachments.

### Best Practices for Users

- **Think before you click** — hover over links, and verify legitimacy.
    
- **Verify with a second channel** — call or message the person if unsure about a request.
    
- **Report suspicious emails** — don’t delete them; escalate to IT/security teams.
    
- **Never enter credentials on suspicious pages** — always navigate to official sites manually.
