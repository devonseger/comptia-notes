# Other Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering attacks extend beyond phishing and impersonation. Many techniques exploit **physical proximity**, **distraction**, **curiosity**, or **misplaced trust** to extract information or gain access. These lesser-known methods are equally critical to understand and defend against.

### Types of Social Engineering Attacks

|Attack Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Diversion Theft**|The attacker manipulates a situation—often by creating a distraction—to **redirect or steal deliveries**, physical items, or information. Example: convincing a courier to leave a package elsewhere.|
|**Hoaxes**|Malicious deceptions spread via email, social media, or messaging platforms. Often **paired with phishing or impersonation** to trick users into downloading malware, sharing credentials, or causing panic.|
|**Shoulder Surfing**|**Physically observing** someone entering sensitive information (e.g., PINs, passwords). Common in public spaces, especially if screens or keyboards are visible.|
|**Dumpster Diving**|Searching through **physical trash or digital repositories** (e.g., deleted files, backups) to recover confidential information such as login credentials, discarded invoices, or design plans.|
|**Eavesdropping**|Secretly **listening to private conversations**, which may occur through physical presence or technical means such as **on-path attacks** (formerly “man-in-the-middle”) on network communications.|
|**Baiting**|Leaving a **malware-infected device** (e.g., USB drive or external hard drive) in a public space in hopes that a victim will plug it into a company system. Curiosity or helpfulness is exploited.|
|**Piggybacking**|Unauthorized individual **follows someone into a secure area with their knowledge** and consent. Example: an attacker asks someone to “hold the door.”|
|**Tailgating**|Similar to piggybacking, but occurs **without the victim’s knowledge**. The attacker sneaks into a secure area behind an authorized person.|

### Prevention & Mitigation

- **Security Awareness Training**  
    Educate employees about subtle social engineering methods, especially physical security tactics like tailgating and baiting.
    
- **Access Controls**  
    Enforce badge-in/badge-out systems, mantraps, and visitor logs to control access to secure areas.
    
- **Shred Documents**  
    Use crosscut shredders for all sensitive documents. Encourage digital clean-up routines as well.
    
- **Screen Privacy Filters**  
    Reduce shoulder surfing risk in public or high-traffic areas.
    
- **Device Control Policies**  
    Block unauthorized USB or removable media by default.
    
- **Encourage Reporting**  
    Create a workplace culture where suspicious behavior or unknown individuals are reported without hesitation.
