# Phishing Attacks

**Phishing** is a type of social engineering attack that uses **fraudulent digital communications**—typically emails—to **trick individuals into revealing sensitive information** such as usernames, passwords, or credit card numbers. These messages often impersonate trusted sources or exploit urgency to manipulate the recipient into acting without caution.

### Types of Phishing Attacks

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Phishing (Generic)**|Mass email campaigns that impersonate legitimate sources (e.g., banks, service providers) to trick users into clicking malicious links or downloading malware.|
|**Spear Phishing**|Highly targeted phishing aimed at specific individuals or groups. Often personalized using public or leaked information to improve credibility.|
|**Whaling**|A subtype of spear phishing targeting **high-profile individuals** (e.g., CEOs, CFOs). Typically used to gain control of executive accounts for further internal compromise.|
|**Vishing**|Short for "voice phishing" — a phone-based scam where attackers impersonate trusted organizations to extract personal or financial data.|
|**Smishing**|Uses **SMS text messages** instead of emails to lure victims into clicking malicious links or sharing private information.|
|**Business Email Compromise (BEC)**|Sophisticated spear phishing attack that compromises a legitimate business email account (e.g., via credential theft or session hijacking) to send **convincing internal emails**. Often used to initiate wire transfers or exfiltrate sensitive data.|
