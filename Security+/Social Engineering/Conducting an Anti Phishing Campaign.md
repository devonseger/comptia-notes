# Conducting an Anti Phishing Campaign

An **anti-phishing campaign** is a proactive security initiative designed to **educate users**, **test their awareness**, and **reduce the success rate of phishing attacks** within an organization. It involves planning, simulation, education, and follow-up.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### **1. Define Campaign Objectives**

- Determine your goals:
    
    - Reduce phishing click rate
        
    - Improve user reporting of suspicious emails
        
    - Identify high-risk departments or individuals
        
- Align with organizational security policies and compliance frameworks
    

#### **2. Obtain Stakeholder Buy-In**

- Involve HR, Legal, IT, and executive leadership
    
- Clarify that this is a **training tool**, not a punitive action
    
- Ensure alignment with employee privacy and labor laws
    

#### **3. Select a Phishing Simulation Platform**

- Use commercial tools (e.g., KnowBe4, Cofense, Proofpoint) or internal solutions
    
- Features to look for:
    
    - Customizable templates
        
    - Real-time reporting
        
    - User risk scoring
        
    - Remedial training capabilities
        

#### **4. Prepare Phishing Scenarios**

- Create diverse templates:
    
    - Credential theft (fake login pages)
        
    - Malicious attachments
        
    - Urgent executive requests (CEO fraud)
        
    - Reward or offer-based lures
        
- Include realistic indicators of phishing (misspellings, mismatched URLs, fake sender domains)
    

#### **5. Segment Your Audience**

- Decide whether to:
    
    - Test all users at once
        
    - Roll out in phases by department or risk level
        
- Tailor emails to job roles (e.g., finance team gets invoice fraud emails)
    

#### **6. Launch the Simulation**

- Send phishing emails over a defined period (e.g., 2â€“4 weeks)
    
- Randomize delivery to prevent word-of-mouth alerts
    

#### **7. Monitor and Record Results**

- Track:
    
    - Email open rate
        
    - Click rate on malicious links
        
    - Data submitted (if using credential harvesting)
        
    - Report rate (who correctly flagged the email)
        
- Identify patterns or repeat offenders
    

#### **8. Provide Remedial Training**

- Automatically enroll users who fell for the phishing email in follow-up awareness training
    
- Include interactive modules, short videos, and quizzes
    

#### **9. Review and Report Metrics**

- Share outcomes with stakeholders:
    
    - % of users who clicked
        
    - % of users who reported
        
    - Risk reduction over time
        
- Use results to guide further training efforts
    

#### **10. Repeat and Refine**

- Run campaigns **quarterly or bi-annually**
    
- Change templates regularly to reflect new attack trends
    
- Incorporate feedback and lessons learned from previous campaigns

### Best Practices

- **Never publicly shame** individuals who fail simulations
    
- Use **positive reinforcement** for users who report simulated or real threats
    
- Combine phishing tests with **ongoing awareness campaigns**
    
- Track user performance over time to **measure ROI** of training programs
