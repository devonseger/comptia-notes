# Pretexting

**Pretexting** is a form of **social engineering** in which an attacker **creates a fabricated scenario (a pretext)** to persuade a target to divulge sensitive information or perform an action they otherwise wouldnâ€™t. It often involves impersonating a trusted figure and constructing a **believable backstory** to support the deception.

---

### Characteristics of Pretexting

- Involves **carefully researched stories** or roles (e.g., IT helpdesk, HR representative, law enforcement, vendor).
    
- Relies on **psychological manipulation**, not technical exploits.
    
- May be conducted **in-person, via phone, email, or online messaging**.
    
- Often used to gather:
    
    - Login credentials
        
    - Personal details (PII)
        
    - Business-sensitive information
        
    - Physical access or access credentials

### Common Pretexting Scenarios

|Scenario|Description|
|---|---|
|**Helpdesk Impersonation**|Pretending to be IT staff asking users to "confirm credentials" for troubleshooting|
|**Vendor Impersonation**|Claiming to be a supplier or contractor needing internal access or account updates|
|**Executive Impersonation (CEO Fraud)**|Targeting finance or HR teams by pretending to be an executive requesting sensitive data or urgent payments|
|**Job Applicant or Surveyor**|Pretending to be conducting a background check or a survey to gather information from employees|
|**Law Enforcement or Auditor**|Claiming to need records for an investigation or audit, preying on urgency and authority|

### Pretexting vs. Impersonation

- **Impersonation** is often the broader act (e.g., pretending to be someone).
    
- **Pretexting** refers to the **story or rationale** the attacker builds to make the impersonation more convincing.
    

> In many cases, **pretexting is a setup for other attacks**, such as phishing or identity theft.

---

### Prevention Strategies

- **User Awareness Training**  
    Teach users to recognize suspicious requests, even if they seem plausible or come from "trusted" sources.
    
- **Verification Procedures**  
    Require identity confirmation through known channels before providing sensitive information or access.
    
- **Limit Public Information Exposure**  
    Reduce the amount of employee or internal data available on websites and social platforms.
    
- **Incident Response and Reporting**  
    Encourage employees to report suspicious interactions, even if they turn out to be false alarms.
